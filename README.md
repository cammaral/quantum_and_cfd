# Quantum & Quantum-Inspired Methods for CFD

This repository contains implementations of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and **Tensor Network (TN)-based solvers** applied to **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** problems.  
The codes are part of the results and demonstrations presented in:

[Quantum machine learning and quantum-inspired methods applied to computational fluid dynamics: a short review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14099v1)

## 

- **PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks):**  
  Neural networks trained to solve PDEs by embedding physical constraints directly into the loss function. We provide examples applied to fluid dynamics problems such as the viscous Burgers’ equation.

- **Tensor Networks (TNs):**  
  Quantum-inspired methods originally from many-body physics, adapted here as efficient solvers for high-dimensional CFD problems. We implement Matrix Product States (MPS) and related tensor network architectures for PDE discretizations.
